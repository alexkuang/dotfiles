## dotfiles

These are my dotfiles.  Until now I've kept them archived in a dropbox somewhere with occasional updates.  But since I'm
about to start programming regularly on more than one machine, I figure now's as good a time as any to follow the
"dotfile repo" trend.

## installing

```sh
git clone https://github.com/holman/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles
script/bootstrap # symlinks dotfiles, etc
script/install # runs all install.sh's
```

Forked shamelessly from [Zach Holman's dotfiles](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles).  Major architectural changes will
be noted here, but so far there aren't any.
